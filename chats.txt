What was your favorite part of the reading?
I liked his section Ordered yet Playful
It closely resembles the studies I did in our last Theory class
Gaming is a continuously growing field which hasthe power to immerse the gamer in a designed experience
It can be used for much more than just crafting narratives but also to make arguments about political and social issues
What did you think of the reading?
One of the lines in Hess's first chapter that stood out to me was The ubiquity of digital technology in a smartphone and internet of things world means that nearly all elements of public discourse are affected by digitality
While this is something I think most people would acknowledge, it's not something that is given more than passing thought on a daily basis
But if people were to take a step back and truly acknowledge how much of what they think and know to be fact has been shaped by the online world, sometimes without their even knowing
What was the most interesting part of the reading?
I'm interested in the Participatory and Reaching aspect of Digital Rhetoric
That is to say the creation of content and the way that content is targeted vs lack of Targeting towards an audience
The postingof shared contentacross social mediaplatforms such as face book orInstagram would be an interesting example
I think a fair amount of this “personal brand” content is created with little couscous thought
Using the rhetorical frame work to look at this content, I think would reveal some underlining trends in persuasive communication
Is there a underlining need to propagate personal political or social causes on a subconscious level? 
Are those urges target towards peers in a way that is interesting or new to digital platforms? 
That sort of thing interests me
What was the best learning moment from the reading? 
For many, it is likely that digital technology already looks less like a technology and more like a common feature of modern existence
What was the best part of the reading? 
Reading: "For many, it is likely that digital technology already looks less like a technology and more like a common feature of modern existence"- this gave me a 'WOW' moment
I still remember the time before cell phones, the internet etc
Today's generation and all the generations that follow will never know/experience what it was like to live without the digital world tied to their fingertips and occupying every corner of their minds
I think being able to grasp this reality is a critical part of being able to communicate effectively to a target audience with the digital media that I create
Technology is here to stay and embracing that is something that will benefit me and my future career endeavors
I am very interested/ have conducted extensive research on the psychology of digital design (what works/ what doesn't and why) and this statement resonates with the content and information I learned throughout my investigations
What was the most interesting part of the readings? 
I found the Ordered yet Playful section about the rhetoric of digital games interesting
I have followed the evolution of video games from the original simple tests of skill and muscle memory into a powerful form of storytelling and even ethical and moral exercises, to studies that have been done on the persuasiveness of virtual reality
Games can be a powerful rhetorical tool
I find the aspect of participatory and reaching interesting
The idea that it is more important you've reached rather a large number of people than whether your point has been heard
What were your favorite readings? 
I actually find all the aspects of digital rhetoric Hess outlines
But the one I find most intriguing is embodied
Embodied is the study of the changing relationship between bodies and devices
As technology evolved it became more mobile which means as it was brought out of a room and into the world texts, sounds, visuals, nonverbal cues, material and virtual spaces are digitized have all become rhetorical 
Bodies have also become digitized through monitoring of heart rates, footsteps etcgiving us a new data of the human body in motion
In addition, digital content can be overlayed onto physical and material spaces creating new meanings
What aspect of the readings intrigued you? 
This aspect intrigues me because my knowledge in this arena is scant and it frankly scares me
I am very skeptical of anything that invades privacy and while I can see some usefulness to this trend I see lots of red flags as well
Yet, I know these innovations will continue to increase in diversity of functions so I need to have a better understanding of this component
Theembodimentof digital rhetoric, or what Hess referred to as the changing
relationship between bodies and devices is interesting to me for two main reasons, both very different and both related to vocation
What idea stuck with you? 
The first has to do with network segmentation and specifically who has access to what information
In my current job, we are looking at how to secure servers and different parts of our network using micro segmentation designs
The intent is to protect more sensitive information from more exposed servers and connections
I wonder how this correlates to recent fcc changes that allow ISPs to regulate traffic for those that are willing to pay more for faster service and the macro segmentation model this introduces
What was a powerful idea for you? 
The other aspect of embodiment has to do with opening a retreat center and in an ever-connect world, create space for getting away from digital rhetoric
A piece from the Hess reading that I found interesting was the digital part of digital rhetoric
What interests me is that it can be theorized as a separate destination from the real world
To me that is very interesting because through this digital channel you can in a way essentially enter a new dimension/world digitally
